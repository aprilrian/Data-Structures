# Data-Structures
Data Structures is part of the software development group, with a focus on the procedural paradigm complemented by algorithmic notation. The implementation of the procedural paradigm involves the use of structured/modular programming techniques. Program solutions are organized into main programs and Abstract Data Types (composite types and operators).
